# grapal-verification
A model of GraphAL embedded in Rosette for query verification.

## Getting Started

To use the language, both a **universe** and a set of **relations** must be provided. To do so, instantiate the `universe` and `relation` structs in `src/graph.rkt`.

An example universe/set-of-relations pair is contained in `test/fixtures/example_database.rkt`.
